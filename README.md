# Library
Built using AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (along with a couple of libraries) on the front-end. The web facing portion is then linked through APIs built in Spring to a Java managed back-end. Data is stored in a MySQL database and managed by Java through Hibernate and Jackson dependencies tied in using Maven.
